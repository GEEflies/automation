GUYS my professor just said: "If I even suspect ChatGPT touched your essay, ZERO." Dead silence in the room. Then he added: "Oxford comma? Fake citation? Zero." Please, for the love of your GPA, I'm begging you to use Studyfetch citations and to actually STUDY. Don’t risk it, ChatGPT isn't risking its degree, you are

I don’t think enough people realise how much chatgpt is killing education. unis can’t actually tell who’s used ai so target ACTUAL smart people and accuse them of using ai. students CHOOSE to use brainrot ai slop like chatgpt not ethical ai that helps instead of cheats like jenni bc they don’t want to use their brain. this is making the world stupider and isn’t talked about enough

um so chat ONE DAY before our essay is due our professor says "if you have fewer than 60 sources in your bibliography you get a ZERO". stunned silence. he keeps yapping about 'research depth' or smth but no one's listening. there's panic. screaming. crying. throwing up. but me? relaxed. been chronically on Reddit and taking sources from Jenni for like a year and already have 80 done for me. incredible feeling. SO chat do i put the class on or do i gatekeep???

psa you can’t learn spanish without the culture. duolingo gives you random words, but never tells you how people actually SAY things. half of language learning comes from literally just hearing things in that language. once i switched to real cultural content, i started picking up slang, filler words, and jokes and now i don’t sound like a textbook lol

People behind me giggled while I awkwardly nodded, holding the loaf like it was exactly what I intended. This one app I used later helped me finally pronounce French words correctly, so my bakery visits are embarrassment-free

My uncle in Mexico City toasted at dinner, eyes wet, and said something in Spanish. Everyone clapped, but all I could do was raise my glass. Later, my cousin whispered: "He was saying how proud he is of you." I felt my chest collapse. I'm learning Spanish with Airlearn now, so I never miss words meant to lift me.

Don’t learn a language just because you have to. Learn it because it’s power. Learn it because no one can ever take it from you. Learn it because you want to connect, to grow, to expand. Learn it because it makes you more. Learn it because it changes how you see the world. Use Airlearn to make that journey easier.

According to neuroscience, your mind can be programmed in 2 weeks to succeed, but only with a focused routine. That's why I use the Deepstash app. 15 min/ day is all it takes to load my brain with the most valuable lessons from the best books on the planet. It isn't for everyone, only for those obsessed with becoming the smartest person in the room.

In Madrid, I proudly walked into a café ready to order. I wanted to say “Un café con leche” (coffee with milk). But nerves hit, and instead I said “Un café con león” (coffee with lion). The waiter froze, then leaned in and whispered, “Raw or cooked?” The whole place laughed. I wanted the floor to swallow me. Now I practice with Airlearn so I order caffeine, not carnivores.

Advice for the corporate girlies 💁‍♀️✨ You're not supposed to know everything. No one hires a first-year analyst, associate, or coordinator expecting you to have all the answers — they hire you for your willingness to learn. So give yourself grace, take notes, ask questions, and if you can... let Summary Ai handle your meeting notes so you can actually focus on learning.
